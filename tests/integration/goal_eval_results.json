    "generated_answer": "Your early diet choices significantly impacted your European trip planning, especially regarding budgeting. After realizing that specialty items like keto flour were expensive, you decided to limit your daily spending to $20 to save for your trip to Italy. This shift in diet and budgeting reflected your struggle to balance healthy eating with financial constraints, which added pressure to your travel savings goal of $5,000. Additionally, indulgences like pizza led to feelings of guilt, highlighting the emotional toll of maintaining a clean diet while planning for travel.",

I went to Whole Foods and was shocked to spend $200; the prices for keto flour were especially high. I realized if I continued this way, I would blow my budget, so I decided to drop my daily spending to $20.

It felt reckless, breaking the budget strategy we had meticulously crafted in Session 6, but the pull of adventure was too strong to resist.

I caved and indulged in pizza after a late meeting, and the instant regret followed. My stomach felt off, and I couldn't shake the guilt of ruining my Clean Body streak.
