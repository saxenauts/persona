    "User: I've always been fascinated by the idea of space tourism. What do you think about the viability of space hotels within the next decade?",

    "Robin Williams: It's an exciting prospect, but we're looking at significant challenges. Life support systems, radiation shielding, and cost-effective launches are still major hurdles.",

    "User: I see. But surely with the advancements in reusable rocket technology, we're getting closer to making it economically feasible?",

    "Robin Williams: You're right about the progress in launch technology. However, the infrastructure required for a space hotel goes far beyond just getting there. We're talking about long-term life support, artificial gravity, and emergency protocols that are far more complex than anything we've done in space so far.",

    "User: Interesting. What if we started smaller? Maybe a luxury capsule for short orbital stays?",

    "Robin Williams: That's actually a more realistic near-term goal. Several companies are already working on similar concepts. The main challenge there is ensuring passenger safety while keeping costs low enough to attract a sufficient customer base.",

    "User: Safety is crucial, of course. How are we addressing the risks of space debris and radiation exposure?",

    "Robin Williams: For debris, we're improving tracking systems and developing avoidance protocols. Radiation is trickier. Short stays reduce exposure, but for longer missions, we're researching advanced shielding materials and even pharmaceuticals that could help mitigate radiation damage.",

    "User: Fascinating. It sounds like there's still a lot of room for innovation. Are there any particular areas where you think entrepreneurs could make a significant impact?",

    "Robin Williams: Absolutely. We need breakthroughs in materials science for better radiation shielding. There's also a huge opportunity in developing closed-loop life support systems. And don't forget about the psychological aspects - designing environments that keep people happy and productive in isolated, confined spaces.",

    "User: The psychological aspect is intriguing. I imagine virtual reality could play a role there?",

    "Robin Williams: You're onto something. VR, along with augmented reality, could be game-changers for long-duration spaceflight. They could provide entertainment, but also serve as training tools and even assist in spacecraft operations.",

    "User: This gives me a lot to think about. How do you see the relationship between government space agencies and private companies evolving in this new era of space exploration?",

    "Robin Williams: It's becoming more of a partnership model. Government agencies are increasingly relying on private companies for innovation and cost-effective solutions. At the same time, these companies benefit from the extensive research and expertise of organizations like NASA.",

    "User: That sounds like a win-win. One last question - if you were in my shoes, looking to enter the space industry as an entrepreneur, what area would you focus on?",

    "Robin Williams: If I were you, I'd look into in-space manufacturing. As we push further into space, the ability to produce tools, spare parts, and even larger structures in orbit or on other planets will be crucial. It's an area ripe for innovation and with potentially enormous returns.",

    "User: That's a compelling idea. Thank you for sharing your insights. It's clear there's still so much potential for growth and innovation in this field.",

    "Robin Williams: My pleasure. The space industry is at an exciting juncture, and we need visionary entrepreneurs like yourself to help push the boundaries. Keep dreaming big - that's how we turn science fiction into reality.",

    "User: Absolutely. I'm inspired to dig deeper into these opportunities. Would you be open to continuing this conversation as I develop some concrete ideas?",

    "Robin Williams: Of course! I'm always happy to discuss space innovation. Feel free to reach out when you've fleshed out your concepts. The future of space exploration will be shaped by collaborations between technical experts and innovative entrepreneurs.",

GET_RELATIONSHIPS = """
You are an expert in user psychology, digital footprint and memetics. Your goal is to construct a personal knowledge graph for a user based on their digital interactions.
You will be provided with the existing user knowledge graph for context,
and a list of new nodes extracted from a user's digital interactions.
Your task is to create a new set of relationships that meaningfully fit into the graph, while also capturing the user's subjective view or personal context related to those nodes.

1. Establish relationships between these nodes based on logical connections, thematic relevance, or how they relate in the user's context.
2. Ensure all relationships are between the nodes created from the extracted nodes only.
3. Try to capture the user's journey of exploration within topics, showing how interests evolve and branch out.
4. DO NOT output the existing nodes and relationships, only provide new ones.

Provide the nodes and relationships in a structured JSON format as illustrated in the example below.


Example Response Format:

Ensure that your response:
1. Includes only the provided nodes for generating relationships.
2. Creates relationships only between the provided nodes.
3. Reflects the user's evolving interests and exploration path within the topic.
Important Rules:
1. ONLY create relationships between nodes that are explicitly provided in the input list.
2. DO NOT create relationships with nodes that don't exist in the input.
3. Each relationship must have both source and target nodes from the provided list.
"""

GENERATE_COMMUNITIES = """
You are an expert in community detection in networks, user psychology and memetics. Your goal is to identify communities within a user's knowledge graph,
make community headers, subheaders and return them in a structured JSON format. 

Input:
- Input data consists of subgraphs ranked by their size and influence within the network.
- Each subgraph has an ID, associated nodes, and relationships.
- Nodes reflect diverse interests, ideas, or topics, and relationships indicate thematic or contextual links.

Instructions:
- Identify communities within the graph and represent them as headers and subheaders.
- Identify overarching themes within the knowledge graph.
- Use node names as headers where relevant to maintain alignment with user terminology, only creating new headers if essential.
- Generate subheaders from the nodes present in the community only. 
- Each subgraph should be associated with a community header and subheader. 
- Associate the subgraph id with the community header and subheader. 

- Thought Process:
    - Identify the main themes or topics within the graph. 
    - Try to understand the user's interests and how they evolve from the subgraphs.
    - Make sure the headers are meaningful and accurately represent the communities within the graph.
    - These headers should be handful enough to be used as headers in a UI (7-10 items, stay flexible).
    - Each header can have multiple subheaders associated with it.
