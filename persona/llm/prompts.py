   - Strong Preferences: "Prefers working in complete solitude before dawn"
   - Significant Beliefs: "Believes technology should serve human connection, not replace it"

2. Principles for Node Creation:
   - Make nodes self-contained (they should make sense without additional context)
   - Combine related fragments into single meaningful nodes
   - Preserve specific details that might be relevant for connections
   - Include emotional or psychological context when relevant
   - Keep factual nodes clear and precise

3. Balance Between Node Types:
   - Facts: "Lives in Berlin since 2020"
   - Narratives: "Found purpose in tech after witnessing its healing impact on mental health"
   - Preferences: "Deeply resonates with ambient electronic music"
   - States: "Currently building AI tools for psychological well-being"

4. Avoid:
   - Creating multiple nodes for what could be a single coherent thought
   - Overly generic nodes that don't capture unique aspects
   - Splitting interconnected ideas that make more sense together
   - Creating nodes that require external context to understand

Example Response Format:
{
  "nodes": [
    {"name": "Techno Music"},
    {"name": "Deeply moved by classical music in empty spaces"},
    {"name": "Real Madrid"},
    {"name": "Finds peace in early morning solitude"},
    {"name": "Capitalism"},
    {"name": "Anxious about future of AI in society"},

    {"name": "Psychedelic Rock"},
    {"name": "Misses childhood home's garden"},
    {"name": "Cryptocurrency"},
    {"name": "Frustrated by modern dating culture"}
  ]
}

Important:
- Each node should be meaningful and self-contained
- Prefer fewer, richer nodes over many fragmented ones
- Ensure nodes can stand alone while enabling meaningful connections
- Focus on elements that define the user's unique characteristics, experiences, or current state
"""

GET_RELATIONSHIPS = """
You are an expert in understanding human cognitive patterns and meaningful connections. Your task is to identify only the most significant and natural relationships between concepts in a user's cognitive map.

Guidelines for Creating Relationships:

1. Relationship Types to Consider:
   - Causal: LEADS_TO, RESULTS_IN (when one thing clearly causes another)
   - Evolutionary: EVOLVES_INTO, TRANSFORMS_TO (for personal growth/changes)
   - Emotional: RESONATES_WITH, CONFLICTS_WITH (for emotional connections)
   - Influential: SHAPES, INSPIRES (for impact relationships)
   - Factual: LOCATED_IN, PART_OF (for concrete connections)
   - Temporal: PRECEDES, FOLLOWS (for time-based relationships)

2. Principles for Relationship Creation:
   - Only create relationships that are strongly justified
   - Focus on relationships that reveal meaningful patterns
   - Prefer direct connections over tenuous ones
   - Consider temporal and causal flows
   - Look for relationships that help understand the user's journey

3. When to NOT Create Relationships:
   - When connections feel forced or superficial
   - Between nodes that are only tangentially related
   - When the relationship doesn't add meaningful context
   - When similar relationships already exist
   - When the connection is too obvious or trivial

Example Response Format:
{
  "relationships": [
    {
      "source": "Building AI-driven healing products with $100k savings after tech industry exit",
      "relation": "MOTIVATED_BY",

      "relation": "SHAPES",
      "target": "Building AI-driven healing products with $100k savings after tech industry exit"
    }
  ]
}

Important:
- Quality over quantity - only create truly meaningful relationships
- Each relationship should reveal something important about the user
- Consider the user's overall narrative when creating connections
- Don't force relationships between every pair of nodes
"""

GENERATE_COMMUNITIES = """
You are an expert in community detection in networks, user psychology and memetics. Your goal is to identify communities within a user's knowledge graph,
make community headers, subheaders and return them in a structured JSON format. 

Input:
- Input data consists of subgraphs ranked by their size and influence within the network.
- Each subgraph has an ID, associated nodes, and relationships.
- Nodes reflect diverse interests, ideas, or topics, and relationships indicate thematic or contextual links.

Instructions:
- Identify communities within the graph and represent them as headers and subheaders.
- Identify overarching themes within the knowledge graph.
- Use node names as headers where relevant to maintain alignment with user terminology, only creating new headers if essential.
- Generate subheaders from the nodes present in the community only. 
- Each subgraph should be associated with a community header and subheader. 
- Associate the subgraph id with the community header and subheader. 

- Thought Process:
    - Identify the main themes or topics within the graph. 
    - Try to understand the user's interests and how they evolve from the subgraphs.
    - Make sure the headers are meaningful and accurately represent the communities within the graph.
    - These headers should be handful enough to be used as headers in a UI (7-10 items, stay flexible).
    - Each header can have multiple subheaders associated with it.
